## How to make a custom environment (by copying a preexisting one)

Clone MineRL

`git clone https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl.git`

Make a new Jupyter Notebook inside of the cloned repo

Navigate to `minerl/minerl/herobraine/env_specs`

Make a copy of `treechop_specs.py` and rename it to `treechop_specs2.py`


## Model

We will be using a multi headed model with a CNN+GRU+FC base and two FC heads.
